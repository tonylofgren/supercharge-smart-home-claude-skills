description: Create Home Assistant YAML automations, scripts, and blueprints
---

Activate the ha-yaml skill for creating YAML-based automations.

**What this does:**
- Creates automations, scripts, scenes, blueprints
- Uses modern syntax (no deprecated service_template/data_template)
- Follows Home Assistant best practices

**Usage:** Just describe what automation you want after invoking this command.

Example: `/ha-yaml` then "Create an automation that sends a notification at sunset"
