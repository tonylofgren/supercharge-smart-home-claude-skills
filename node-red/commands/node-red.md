description: Create Node-RED flows for Home Assistant automation
---

Activate the node-red skill for creating visual Node-RED flows.

**What this does:**
- Uses node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket nodes
- Generates importable JSON flows
- Follows current API (trigger-state, api-call-service)

**Usage:** Just describe what flow you want after invoking this command.

Example: `/node-red` then "Create a flow that turns on lights when motion is detected"
